These algorithms often incorporate sophisticated techniques, such as noise modeling, label correction, and co-training. In this study, we demonstrate that a simple baseline using cross-entropy loss, combined with widely used regularization strategies like learning rate decay, model weights average, and data augmentations, can outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that employing a combination of regularization strategies can be more effective than intricate algorithms in tackling the challenges of learning with noisy labels. While some of these regularization strategies have been utilized in previous noisy label learning research, their full potential has not been thoroughly explored. Our results encourage a reevaluation of benchmarks for learning with noisy labels and prompt reconsideration of the role of specialized learning algorithms designed for training with noisy labels.","tags":[],"title":"Unleashing the Potential of Regularization Strategies in Learning with Noisy Labels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huaxi Huang","Hui Kang","Sheng Liu","Olivier Salvado","Thierry Rakotoarivelo","Dadong Wang","Tongliang Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1690070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690070400,"objectID":"4f6b48a32aa7e5a6a17721cb3b5c679f","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/iccv23/","publishdate":"2023-07-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iccv23/","section":"publication","summary":"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful in learning patterns of different vision tasks, but they are sensitive to label noise and may overfit to noisy labels during training. The early stopping strategy averts updating CNNs during the early training phase and is widely employed in the presence of noisy labels. Motivated by biological findings that the amplitude spectrum (AS) and phase spectrum (PS) in the frequency domain play different roles in the animal's vision system, we observe that PS, which captures more semantic information, can increase the robustness of CNNs to label noise, more so than AS can. We thus propose early stops at different times for AS and PS by disentangling the features of some layer(s) into AS and PS using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) during training. Our proposed Phase-AmplituDe DisentangLed Early Stopping (PADDLES) method is shown to be effective on both synthetic and real-world label-noise datasets.

The main challenge in FSS is determining the query pixel labels by referencing the class prototypes learned from the few labeled support exemplars. Previous methods focus on independently learning the class-wise descriptors from support images, which ignores the detailed contextual information and mutual relations of support-query features. To address this issue, we propose a joint learning method, Masked Cross-Image Encoding (MCE), to mine common visual properties describing object details and learn bidirectional inter-image dependencies enhancing feature interaction. MCE is more than a visual representation enrichment module; it also considers the cross-image mutual dependencies and contextual information. Thus the labeled visual feature representations of support images are better exploited to guide the prediction of a query image. Experiments on public FSS benchmarks PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i demonstrate the state-of-the-art meta-learning performance of the proposed method.","tags":[],"title":"Masked Cross-image Encoding For Few-shot Segmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1658361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658361600,"objectID":"f5dde52c724b22034dd331cbe07992a1","permalink":"https://example.com/post/mmsp/","publishdate":"2022-07-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/mmsp/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Huaxi accepted the invitation to serve as an Area Chair for MMSP 2022.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Huaxi Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1649808000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1649808000,"objectID":"4388ec308c64fdfc5d1ad8fe9c14d9b4","permalink":"https://example.com/post/phd/","publishdate":"2022-04-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/phd/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Huaxi has received his Ph.D. from UTS.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Huaxi Huang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648425600,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://example.com/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2022-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Huaxi has enrolled as a CERC researcher in Data61.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Huaxi Huang","Junjie Zhang","Jian Zhang","Qiang Wu","Chang Xu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1621296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621296000,"objectID":"3f63b023de3df77eb90974843db24222","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/aaai/","publishdate":"2021-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aaai/","section":"publication","summary":"The predicament in semi-supervised few-shot learning (SSFSL) is to maximize the value of the extra unlabeled data to boost the few-shot learner. In this paper, we propose a Poisson Transfer Network (PTN) to mine the unlabeled information for SSFSL from two aspects. First, the Poisson Merriman–Bence–Osher (MBO) model builds a bridge for the communications between labeled and unlabeled examples. This model serves as a more stable and informative classifier than traditional graph-based SSFSL methods in the message-passing process of the labels. Second, the extra unlabeled samples are employed to transfer the knowledge from base classes to novel classes through contrastive learning. Specifically, we force the augmented positive pairs close while push the negative ones distant. Our contrastive transfer scheme implicitly learns the novel-class embeddings to alleviate the over-fitting problem on the few labeled data. Thus, we can mitigate the degeneration of embedding generality in novel classes.

The core predicament in FGFS is the high intra-class variance yet low inter-class fluctuations in the dataset. In traditional fine-grained classification, the high intra-class variance can be somewhat relieved by conducting the supervised training on the abundant labeled samples. However, with few labeled examples, it is hard for the FGFS model to learn a robust class representation with the significantly higher intra-class variance. Moreover, the inter- and intra-class variance are closely related. The significant intra-class variance in FGFS often aggravates the low inter-class variance issue. To address the above challenges, we propose a Target-Oriented Alignment Network (TOAN) to tackle the FGFS problem from both intra- and inter-class perspective. To reduce the intra-class variance, we propose a target-oriented matching mechanism to reformulate the spatial features of each support image to match the query ones in the embedding space. To enhance the inter-class discrimination, we devise discriminative fine-grained features by integrating local compositional concept representations with the global second-order pooling. We conducted extensive experiments on four public datasets for fine-grained categorization, and the results show the proposed TOAN obtains the state-of-the-art.","tags":[],"title":"TOAN: Target-Oriented Alignment Network for Fine-Grained Image Categorization with Few Labeled Samples","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huaxi Huang","Junjie Zhang","Jian Zhang","Qiang Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591833600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591833600,"objectID":"9deaddf4084681dfdd34f0d5f228e85b","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/tmm/","publishdate":"2020-06-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tmm/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks have demonstrated advanced abilities on various visual classification tasks, which heavily rely on the large-scale training samples with annotated ground-truth. However, it is unrealistic always to require such annotation in real-world applications. Recently, Few-Shot learning (FS), as an attempt to address the shortage of training samples, has made significant progress in generic classification tasks. Nonetheless, it is still challenging for current FS models to distinguish the subtle differences between fine-grained categories given limited training data. To filling the classification gap, in this paper, we address the Few-Shot Fine-Grained (FSFG) classification problem, which focuses on tackling the fine-grained classification under the challenging few-shot learning setting. A novel low-rank pairwise bilinear pooling operation is proposed to capture the nuanced differences between the support and query images for learning an effective distance metric. Moreover, a feature alignment layer is designed to match the support image features with query ones before the comparison.
